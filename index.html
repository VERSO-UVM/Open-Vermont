        <p>Open Vermont is a community-driven platform designed to organize and empower people to collectively solve problems. These challenges range from large-scale systemic issues to very local concerns. Our approach emphasizes building open source technology—including software, hardware, and data—and fostering a culture of reuse and upcycling through initiatives like the Right to Repair movement.</p>
        
        <p>We believe that collaboration and transparency are key to creating sustainable solutions. By leveraging open source practices, we can share knowledge, reduce waste, and innovate together for the benefit of all Vermonters.</p>
        
        <p>One of the core ideas behind Open Vermont is enabling community members to submit opportunities they believe could be improved. These opportunities might involve infrastructure, education, technology, or everyday challenges. By surfacing these ideas, we create a space where others can join in, contribute resources, and vote on priorities—turning good ideas into actionable projects.</p>
